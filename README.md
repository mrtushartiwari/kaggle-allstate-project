## About the dataset

Allstate is an american insurance company, which has organised a recruitment kaggle competition in October 2016. At that time Allstate was developing automatic methods of predicting the cost of insurance claims.

A tabular dataset was given,having around 188k rows where each row is representing an insurance claim [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity). The data contains 116 categorical and 14 continuous features. Due to privacy concerns there is no description available for the features,so we do not know what a particular feature represents in the real world.


### Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the value for the ‘loss’ column,which is a continuous value using various machine learning techniques.
